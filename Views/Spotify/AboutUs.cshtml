                <p style="text-align: justify;">I have four years of experience in Java and am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida. Alongside my studies, I'm gaining practical industry experience through my internship at Tenex Software Solutions as a .NET Developer. I built an index page that displays all playlists for a specific user, giving them easy access to manage their collections. I added functionality to let users edit playlist names and descriptions directly on the page, making it straightforward to customize and organize their playlists without needing extra steps. This feature improves the user experience by simplifying playlist management and enabling a more personalized interaction with their content.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">I have five years of experience as a Data Analyst and am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems at the University of South Florida. In addition, I am gaining hands-on experience through my internship at Pranatree. I developed a series of charts to provide a comprehensive visual representation of an artist’s key metrics. The charts include the artist’s top 10 tracks, showcasing track popularity and enabling a quick comparison of listener preferences. I also added a chart to display the artist's follower count, offering insights into fan base growth. Additionally, I implemented a gauge chart to visualize the artist’s popularity score, highlighting their overall appeal relative to other artists. Lastly, I created a line chart that tracks album releases over the years, revealing trends in the artist’s productivity and evolution over time.</p>

The edit page provides functionality for modifying track attributes, enabling users to customize track details efficiently. These pages streamline playlist management by offering clear, accessible tools for interacting with each track directly.</p>
